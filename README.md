## Credit Scoring Using Machine Learning and AI

Credit scoring refers to the process of evaluating the creditworthiness of an individual or business to determine their ability to repay loans or manage credit obligations. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) enhance this process by leveraging advanced computational techniques to analyze vast amounts of data and uncover complex patterns.

In a credit scoring system powered by ML and AI, algorithms are trained on historical data, such as credit history, income, spending behavior, and demographic information. These algorithms learn to identify key factors that influence credit risk and make predictions about the likelihood of repayment. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined scoring rules, ML models adapt to new data, improving their accuracy and flexibility.

AI also enables automated decision-making and real-time credit assessments, reducing human bias and increasing efficiency. Furthermore, the use of explainable AI techniques helps ensure transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements. As a result, ML and AI-based credit scoring provide more inclusive, dynamic, and reliable credit evaluations for lenders and borrowers alike.
